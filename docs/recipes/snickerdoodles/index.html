<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>388g AP Flour</li>
<li>2 tsp Cream Of Tartar</li>
<li>1 tsp Baking Soda</li>
<li>3/4 tsp Salt</li>
<li>1.5 tsp Ground Cinnamon</li>
<li>223g Unsalted Butter, room temperature</li>
<li>300g Granulated Sugar</li>
<li>2 Large Eggs</li>
<li>1/4 cup Spice Blend</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spice-blend">Spice Blend</h2>
<p>The spice blend I do is inexact.  I make it in batches and use as needed as it&rsquo;s much easier to work with in larger quantities.</p>
<ul>
<li>2tbsp granulated sugar</li>
<li>1.5tbsp cinnamon</li>
<li>1/2tsp allspice</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon cardamon</li>
<li>Pinch of ground clove.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t worked with clove before beware!!  A bit here is like maybe 1/8tsp, probably/possibly less.  The tiniest bit too much clove will instantly turn your cookies into eau du goth club.  Pre-making batches of spiceblend helps here. If it doesn&rsquo;t smell/taste right on a quick test, add more of whatever else it needs.  You can do just cinnamon and sugar if you have the fear, that&rsquo;s the traditional thing.  And it&rsquo;s really hard to work with clove in super small batches.  But I think the extra spices are worth it.</p>
<h2 id="dough">Dough</h2>
<p>In a large bowl whisk together flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, and 1.5 tsp of cinnamon. Set aside.</p>
<p>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 3–5 minutes. Then beat in both eggs, stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>Turn mixer on low and slowly add 1/3 of the flour mixture until combined. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl, ensuring there are no dry ingredients at the bottom.  Turn mixer on low again, adding the next 1/3 of the flour mixture until combined. Stop the mixer, scrape the bowl, and continue with the final 1/3 of the flour.</p>
<p>Chill dough for 30-60 minutes in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Place spice mixture in a small bowl and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</p>
<p>Use a 1.5 tablespoon cookie scoop to measure out dough balls (about 28g). Roll each ball in your hands to even them out, then roll in spice mixture to thoroughly coat. Place the balls on prepared baking sheets, 2 inches apart.  Chill for 30-60 minutes OR freeze for up to 30 days in an airtight container.</p>
<h2 id="bake">Bake</h2>
<p>Preheat the oven to 400ºF.</p>
<p>Bake one sheet at a time for 9–10 minutes in the center rack of the oven, until just barley golden around the edges. Cool for several minutes on the baking sheets before moving to a wire rack to cool to room temperature.</p>
<p>Can be stored for 5-7 days in an airtight container.</p>
<h2 id="optional-to-prepare-from-frozen">Optional: To prepare from frozen</h2>
<p>Defrost 4-6 hours (or overnight) in the refrigerator then proceed with baking instructions.</p>
