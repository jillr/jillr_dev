Beets are the best!

Ingredients
-----------

* 1/2 large yellow onion, diced
* 1 small red cabbage, roughly chopped
* 5-6 medium to large beets, diced into roughly 1-1.5cm cubes
* 2-3 medium carrots, finely sliced (I use a mandolin, with the carrot held vertically, to get approximately 1-2cm wide and 2-3mm thick slices)
* 3 medium Yukon Gold, Russet, or similar starchy white potatoes diced into 1-1.5cm cubes
* 8 cups (190mL) vegetable stock
* 3 tbsp tomato paste
* 2 tbsp neutral vegetable oil
* 3 tbsp butter
* 4 cloves crushed garlic
* 2 tbsp sweet paprika
* 2 tsp white pepper
* About 2 tsp salt, to taste
* 5-6 dried bay leaves
* 1/2 cup fresh dill weed

Equipment
---------

* Dutch oven or heavy bottomed soup pot
* Medium pot

Instructions
------------

Peel and chop the beets and roast on an aluminum covered sheet pan for 30-40 minutes in a 400F (200C) oven.  Cover with foil halfway through to prevent them from scorching.

Parboil the potatoes in a medium pot for about 7 minutes.  Drain, and then shock in cold water to stop them from cooking further.

Begin heating the vegtable stock in a medium pot.  It will need to be warm before it is added to the soup but you don't need to boil it.

Heat the vegetable oil in the dutch oven on medium-low heat on the stove top.

Add the onions to the oil and saute until soft and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.

Add the paprika and garlic to the onions and saute for 1 minute.

Add the tomato paste and saute for 1 minute.

Add the carrots and saute for 3-4 minutes.

Add the butter, cabbage, white pepper, and salt. Stir and saute for 5 minutes until the cabbage begins to soften.

Add the stock and bring to a boil over medium high heat, then reduce to medium heat and let simmer.

Add the beets, potato, and bay leaf to the broth.

Allow the soup to simmer on medium-low to medium heat for 45-60 minutes (don't boil).

Stir in chopped fresh dill weed.

Serve hot with a dollop of sour cream and a slice of bread and butter.

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 2-3 days (if it lasts that long!).
